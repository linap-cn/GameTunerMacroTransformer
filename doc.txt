public static MotionEvent obtain (long downTime, long eventTime, int action, float x, float y, float pressure, float size, int metaState, float xPrecision, float yPrecision, int deviceId, int edgeFlags)

Added in API level 1
Create a new MotionEvent, filling in all of the basic values that define the motion.

Parameters
downTime	The time (in ms) when the user originally pressed down to start a stream of position events. This must be obtained from uptimeMillis().
eventTime	The the time (in ms) when this specific event was generated. This must be obtained from uptimeMillis().
action	The kind of action being performed, such as ACTION_DOWN.
x	The X coordinate of this event.
y	The Y coordinate of this event.
pressure	The current pressure of this event. The pressure generally ranges from 0 (no pressure at all) to 1 (normal pressure), however values higher than 1 may be generated depending on the calibration of the input device.
size	A scaled value of the approximate size of the area being pressed when touched with the finger. The actual value in pixels corresponding to the finger touch is normalized with a device specific range of values and scaled to a value between 0 and 1.
metaState	The state of any meta / modifier keys that were in effect when the event was generated.
xPrecision	The precision of the X coordinate being reported.
yPrecision	The precision of the Y coordinate being reported.
deviceId	The id for the device that this event came from. An id of zero indicates that the event didn't come from a physical device; other numbers are arbitrary and you shouldn't depend on the values.
edgeFlags	A bitfield indicating which edges, if any, were touched by this MotionEvent.
